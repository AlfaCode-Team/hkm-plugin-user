 * Component test for `User/Register`.

 * Props come from __fixtures__/user-register.json, which a ground test dumped
 * from a REAL response:
 *
 *   $this->ground()->pageflow('/your/route')
 *       ->writeFixture(__DIR__ . '/../ui/__fixtures__/user-register.json');
 *
 * That is the point of the fixture. Hand-written mock props drift from the
 * server the moment a field is renamed, and this test keeps passing while
 * the page breaks. With the dump, a server-side rename fails it here.
 *
 * Re-dump the fixture when the props change, and commit it.
 *
 * The PageContext wrapper is not optional: a Pageflow page reads its props
 * through `usePage()`, which THROWS on an empty context, so passing props
 * as JSX attributes renders nothing. The value is the whole page object —
 * the same thing <App> supplies at runtime, and the same shape the fixture
 * holds.
